        <p class="text-lg text-black" style="width: 853px;">Beginners and leaner individuals who tend to have difficulty gaining weight can aim to gain anywhere between 0.5-1lbs per week. Heavier individuals may be able to gain 1-2lbs per week especially if they are able to gain weight easier than others. By tracking your weekly weight gain, you can make sure you are eating enough calories to hit those ranges, but also monitor your rate of weight gain to make sure you are not gaining too much weight, too fast. If you gain too much weight, too fast, it could impair optimal muscle growth and increase the amount of fat you gain during a bulk.
        <br/><br/>6 Ways to Maximize the Muscle Building Process During a Bulk
        <br/><br/>Below are six (6) tips for maximizing muscle growth during the bulk!
        <br/>1. Start Your Bulk from a Lean State
        <br/>Ideally, you would start your bulk from a lean state, meaning that your body fat levels would be near 10% or lower for males, and ~16% for females.  
        <br/>While these body fat percentages are not set in stone, the takeaway here is that the leaner you are when you start a bulk, the more your body will want to begin using the net calories to fuel hard training, recovery, and muscle growth (and increase glucose stores in muscle bellies). <br/>2. Progressively Eat More Calories<br/>When looking to gain muscle and weight during a bulk, you need to eat more calories than you burn off (resting metabolic rate + calories burned from lifestyle + calories burned from physical activity). 
        <br/>Itâ€™s a basic math equation that has been repeatedly proven. To gain weight, you must be in a caloric surplus. To lose weight, you must be in a caloric deficit.
        <br/>Eating anything you want is one way to do this; however, it can affect the make up of the weight you are gaining (and how fast you are gaining weight). </p>
